# DevOps & Cloud Infra Showcase 🚀

This repository is a collection of reusable Terraform modules, cloud architecture demos, and automation patterns I use to design secure, reliable, and cost-efficient infrastructures.

## 🌍 What you’ll find here
- **Terraform Modules** → ready-to-use building blocks (VPCs, logging, CI/CD pipelines, cost optimization).  
- **Infra Demos** → small, deployable projects showing best practices in cloud security, monitoring, and automation.  
- **Docs & Guides** → short explanations of the “why” and “how” behind each solution.  

## 🎯 Goals
- Share practical DevOps & Cloud solutions that CTOs and engineers can reuse.  
- Highlight modern patterns for AWS + Terraform.  
- Learn in public and give back to the community.
